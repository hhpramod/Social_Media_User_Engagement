ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Power BI Dashboard! ðŸŽ‰

I recently designed this interactive "Social Media User Engagement" dashboard to analyze user behavior across various platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and more. The dashboard highlights key insights, including:
 Total daily minutes spent by users.
 Engagement metrics like posts, likes, and follows per day.
 Platform-specific trends with clear KPIs and user distribution.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
âœ… Interactive Filters: Explore data by specific platforms.
âœ… Custom KPIs: Track goals for daily time, posts, and engagement scores.
âœ… User-Friendly Visuals: Easily spot trends with dynamic graphs and metrics.

ðŸ’» Tools Used:
 Power BI for dashboard development.
 DAX for custom measures and KPIs.

This project reflects my expertise in data visualization and creating actionable insights using Power BI. I ensured the design is both visually appealing and functional, making it easy to identify key performance indicators at a glance.
